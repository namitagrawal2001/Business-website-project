Tech Used
• HTML
• CSS
• Git and GitHub
• Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)
• Nginx
• AWS EC2

Step-by-Step Process

1. Built the website locally using VS Code.
2. Created a GitHub repository named business-website-project.
3. Pushed all website files to GitHub.
4. Launched an EC2 instance (Ubuntu 22.04, t2.micro).
5. Connected to the server using SSH.
6. Installed Nginx on EC2 and started the service.
7. Installed Git on the server.
8. Cloned the website repository from GitHub.
9. Removed default Nginx files from /var/www/html.
10. Moved project files into the Nginx root directory.
11. Restarted Nginx to load the website.
12. Tested the website with the Elastic IP.

Errors Faced
• Wrong file path while moving files.
• CSS not loading due to directory structure issues.
• Permission issues in /var/www/html.

How I Solved Them
• Used correct mv commands.
• Fixed asset and image paths.
• Applied correct permissions using chmod and chown.
• Restarted Nginx every time.

Final Output
• Fully working multi-page business website.
• Hosted on AWS EC2 with Elastic IP.
• Nginx serving all pages.
• Complete Git to EC2 workflow implemented.
